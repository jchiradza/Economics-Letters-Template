<div>The Zimbabwean Tax system is administered by the Zimbabwe revenue authority (ZIMRA) since 2001. The authority was enacted by an act of parliament, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority Act in 2001 and took over tax administration from the Department of taxes, which had been running tax administration since independence. The act mandated the authority to collect tax on behalf of the state for the benefit of the consolidated revenue fund. The authority directly administers all tax acts which are Income Tax Act (ITA) Chapter 23:06, Finance Act Chapter 23:04, VAT Act Chapter 23:12 and Capital Gains Act Chapter 23:01. Active tax heads under administration are Value Added Tax (VAT), Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax (CGT), Pay as You Earn (Pechnology AYE). 
</div><div>Zimbabwean Income tax is sourced based, meaning that in term of the act, any amount which is from a source or deemed to be from a source in Zimbabwe is liable to taxation. Income is matched against expenses relating to the income for the period of assessment to arrive at the tax payable after adjusting for credits and other non deductible expenditure.&nbsp; Taxpayers declare under income tax at 25% and an additional 3% of the tax as Aids Levy of the taxable income and payable by 31 March of following year.

The tax system is designed such that the expenditure gives rise to Input tax while sales (turnover) gives rise to Output tax. The mechanics of VAT says that tax payable or refundable is the difference between input tax and output tax with a negative giving a refund and positive treated accordingly. The VAT sales are categorized into three commodity classes depending on commodity characteristics. At the top are commodities charged at 15% of Value of supply referred to as standard rated supplies, Zero rated supplies charged at 0% and finally exempt supplies which do not attract VAT.&nbsp; Purchases follow the same order. Input tax claims are based on purchase invoices and have been the source of much of the VAT fraud cases </div><h2 data-label="655664" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2><a></a><a>Vat system in Zimbabwe and Mechanics of VAT</a><span></span></h2>
