<h1 data-label="874460" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>The  world has evolved a lot over the years. Amongst the most dramatic revolutions  was the rise of the internet. Some writers classified it as a disruptive  technology, capable of bringing whole sale change to how business are organized  and could actually decide whether a business survive or fail. <a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>The  invention of the telegraph changed the world forever. Coupled with computing  power, the internet has fast-forwarded the world into a very dynamic digital or  the information era. The world was suddenly connected and all sectors of the  global economy be it government or private found themselves faced with a new  challenge. This involved having to deal with the world and people operating  without boundaries and some remotely where local laws fail to govern their  behavior. Constant adaptation or more specifically a learning organization set  up is now crucial for survival.&nbsp;&nbsp; As  McLuhan put it “Ours<i>  is a brand-new world of all-at-once-ness. ‘Time’ has ceased, ‘space’ has  vanished. We now live in a ‘global village’…a simultaneous happening.  Information pours upon us, instantaneously and continuously. As soon as  information is acquired, it is very rapidly replaced by still newer  information”.</i><i><i>&nbsp;</i>(MacLuhan, 1967).&nbsp; </i>Certain issues come to the fore  when internet is mentioned which are, cybersecurity and in a more positive and  fancy tone “internet of things”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>.  Obviously what these words tells us is that with increased connectivity comes  numerous risks such as loss of geographical significance in transactions, data  theft, hacking , cyber theft and for governments possible revenue leakage  through transfer pricing, unfavorable rules regarding profit allocation and  taxing rights and dealing with cross boarder online transactions. Because an  average 46% of the world owns a smart phone, Laptop or some electronic device  capable of providing the connectivity and flexibility the internet is offering,  globalization is now inevitable. (Australian Computer Society, 2016) &nbsp;There is no way out, neither is there a way to  avoid the proliferation of technology based innovations in how business is  conducted or how payments are made across networks even without the blessings  of the government.</div><div>Disruptive  technologies such as Bitcoin and block chain created a wide range of  opportunities in  various business and administration models allowing for transformation to new  lean and more  efficient models both in private and government. The private sector has since  jumped on the band wagon. Block chain avenues are being explored including,  stores management, financial services, and parcel tracking through technologies  based on private block chain networks. (Iansiti &amp; Karim, 2017)The most  notable is the crypto currencies with Bitcoin which was developed by Satoshi  Nakamoto and thereum leading the pack in public distributed ledger/block chain  application (Nakamoto, 2008).</div><div>Governments  generally take time to adopt changing technologies in their operations and they  generally use paper based systems. Possible widespread adoption of these  technologies by the private sector which they should monitor and control might  see them incompatible with the rest of the economy and vulnerable. Iansiti and  Lakhani in their paper do not see worldwide transformation or adoption Block  chain technologies of world in the very near future, however eventually change  is coming says cryptographer, Ralph C. Merkle “(Zhang, Miranskyy, &amp; Rjaibi,  2019). It is a clear signal that even traditional systems will come to pass  with wide acceptance of these disruptive technologies. At World Economic Forum  in Davos in 2016, of the 800 executives and experts questioned on when they  thought governments would start to implement blockchain in tax administration,  73% said blockchain will be implemented by 2025. (CIAT, 2018)&nbsp; The meteoric rise of Bitcoin both in value  and world wide acceptance as a currency of exchange, is a clear testimony of  how inevitable technological development can be. At the same time it exposes  the lack of preparedness of even the most advanced economies as most are still  busy crafting legislation and structures to govern them. In the global south,  some economies do not yet recognize crypto-currency even if their citizens  transact using it. According to a report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG),  significant investment to the tune of billions of United States dollars is being  channeled towards both Block chain and Quantum computing. (Philipp &amp; Ruess,  2018). </div><div>The  technologies highlighted also signals the arrival of decentralized governance, which  is crucial in order to keep abreast of these technological advances and the  complexities of these coming transaction and data processing technologies.  Sooner or later most governments will have to embrace some form of technology  as a way of ensuring efficiency in their operations and safeguarding revenues.  One such area is the area of tax administration where numerous efforts have  been made to reduce the risk of tax revenue leakages due to system shortcomings  and fraud with investments in automation, increased controls and risk  management techniques. Of course the major or glaring sources of the fraud and  inefficiencies are the human intervention in existing systems and the increased  complexity of transactions. Accordingly these create avenues for bribes,  corruption and tax evasion. According to the tax authority in Zimbabwe “A total  of 46 cases involving tax administrators were investigated during the period 1  January to 15 August 2018”.&nbsp;(Matebesi, 2018). In 2019, Zimbabwean  tax authority (ZIMRA) also claim to have collected ZWL75 million from cases of  fraud under investigation.&nbsp;(Mangudhla, 2019). Like they say” it  takes two to tango” it is apparent that both tax officials and taxpayers are  actively participating in activities of fraud, bribery system manipulation and  theft resulting in huge losses to the fiscus. A solution needs to be found  which minimizes human intervention in transactions and tax computations in a  way that significantly reduce tax leakages and inefficiencies. Bitcoin opened  our eyes to a novel concept called block chain which has capacity to limit user  manipulation in transactions. The Bitcoin is now revered as a fully fledged  digital currency which rivals traditional currency controlled by the central  bank. Taking cues from, the numerous qualities and characteristics of Bitcoin  and blockchain, this paper seeks to explore the block chain architecture and  its possible uses in VAT tax administration taking advantage of its self  regulating features such as agreement by consensus, immutability of  transactions, time stamping of transactions and the fact that most activities  in occur in real-time. The questions to be answered in this paper are, firstly,  what weakness does the traditional VAT system have? &nbsp;Secondly does Blockchain have the capacity to  address VAT fraud? Finally, does introduction of blockchain improve speed of  refund processing?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h1><a>Literature review</a><span></span></h1><div>VAT  is not very old as it was adopted in the late 60's, blockchain is however even  newer than VAT. Block chain is yet t be found in many tax administrations. Even  if literature is still limited on the subject. However many studies on the  technology are exploring the possibility of the </div><div>Major  theories of tax compliance usually recognize the role played by the tax  administration in ensuring that the effort expended towards complying  voluntarily should be commensurate with the amount of tax to be paid and the gain  from collected taxes by the government. It is one way to reduce the cost of  complying and another t reduce the cost of collection per dollar. Most papers  on automation of tax administration and in particular the introduction of  blockchain concur with main stream theories in that any new technology  disruptive or not should aim to reduce these two costs and taxpayers will  automatically and voluntarily comply. </div><div>Dimaz Ankaa Wijayaa, Fengkie Junisb and Dony Ariadi Suwarsono  studied the possible adoption of Blockchain in stamp duty collection in Indonesia.  Their conclusion was that it was very feasible, to collect stamp duty using a  block chain based system. The key gains highlighted in their paper included  increased quantum of state revenue in the stamp duty sector, increasing  convenience for the  taxpayers to pay the stamp, and increasing the transparency and auditability of  the stamp duty mechanisms. Their strongest selling point was the ability to electronically  stamp documents in a manner traceable and auditable for tax purposes and use of  tokens.&nbsp;(Wijaya, Junis, &amp; Suwarsono,   2018)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Okazaki researched on applicability  of Blockchain technology in customs. Like all the other papers his conclusion  was that blockchain will prevent possible frauds; enhanced accuracy of recorded  data; contracts’ self-execution without intermediary; and immediate and  permanent sharing  of information&nbsp;(Okazaki, 2018),In his conclusion  Okazaki, highlighted that having a block chain system also help he customs  function to have all the relevant informational and to embed its sale in  international trade channels. </div><div>The most prominent proponents  of block chain technology in taxation, Ainsworth and Alwohaibi also claims that  the gains likely to be obtained from blockchain implementation warrants that  tax administration take note. In his paper “Blockchain, Bitcoin,  and VAT in the GCC: The missing Trader”, their study which focused  mainly on trade between a group of nations with the EU under a block chain  based VAT system, they concluded that the missing trader fraud problem will  greatly be reduced. They also concluded that the key problems pertinent to  voluntary compliance, cost of complying and cost of collection would be  addressed. Their findings revealed that blockchain will improve efficiency, security and transparency.&nbsp;(Ainsworth   &amp; Alwohaibi, 2017)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Disruptive technologies are technologies which ‘brings to a market  a very different value proposition than had been available previously’.  Christensen highlighted that that these technologies different from sustainable  technologies as they do not always bring beneficial effects but can actually  lead to business failure. &nbsp;(Christensen, 2017)</div><div><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a> The Internet of Things (IoT) encompasses the many and varied  devices currently on the market, or soon to be on the market, which will connect  to and stay, connected to the internet 24/7.<span></span></div>
