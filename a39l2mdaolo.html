<h1 data-label="687807" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><div>The  mechanics of the blockchain technology is as follows. It starts with a set of  players or nodes united by some communication medium, which in this case are  the internet and an interface technology in the form of software. All notes  running the software are automatically connected to the network. They also  automatically get two sets of digital keys (hash) for identification purposes,  one private one public. The keys are required to authenticate  transactions.&nbsp; Because the connection to  the network is random and not hierarchical all nodes carries the same weight in  terms of functionality and authority (see fig.2 above). In effect they are  “peers”. Once one of the nodes generates a transaction or set of transactions  all the nodes will use the public key distributed by the sending node to verify  the origin and authenticity of the transaction. When all the nodes have in  principle authenticated the transactions it is added to form the first block in  the chain. The next transaction or set thereof will be will be similarly  authenticated by all nodes and a new block is created. Once the block is  authenticated, the nodes will create a hash or digital signature that links the  previous block with the present one. Once a block is added it becomes  theoretically impossible to edit as all other blocks in the chain will need to  be revisited and amend, each amendment requires authentication by all the  participating nodes. The longer the chain the more difficult it becomes to edit  the blocks. </div>
