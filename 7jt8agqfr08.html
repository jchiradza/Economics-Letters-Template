<h1 data-label="687807" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><div>The  question of whether Zimbabwe can adopt blockchain technology into its VAT  annals is one most tax administrators dare not even talk about. The existing  challenges with existing technology appear more than enough to even envision a  more revolutionary and untested system anywhere else. Yet, Satoshi managed to  get it working for Bitcoin and massive gains have been achieved through speed  of transactions, reduced intermediation costs which lead improved and more  efficient payment system. For a tax system though not simple but the gains  through improved efficiency, speed of refund, prevention of human invention  motivated fraud, automatic and real-time third part verification of input  claims, daily reconciliation of VAT position, reduced cost of compliance by clients  as less paper work will be required and ultimately reduced monitoring costs on  the part of the tax administration. Surely a system like that would cut costs  on both sides in many ways at the same time requiring very few modifications to  the clients existing infrastructure if any.</div><div>The  proposed system will be based on existing infrastructure and would be a cross  platform software running on all computer ecosystems and mobile devices. The  proposed system borrows some concepts from Richard Ainsworth and Alwohaibi who  pioneered this field of blockchain in tax administration.&nbsp;(Ainsworth &amp; Alwohaibi, 2017) . However certain  pieces of legislation would need to be reviewed to allow smooth flow of the  system. As is always the case no matter how good any system might look, it will  almost always not eliminate the need for human intervention but those systems  most likely going to reduce that intervention allowing for automation are  generally preferred. In this particular case the VAT system is already existent  and generally works well, on the other hand Blockchain is now upon us and being  successfully used elsewhere. Marrying the two and coming up with a VAT system  that is robust, temper proof, transparent and efficient is the goal of this  model building. Below is a model Blockchain based VAT system.</div>
