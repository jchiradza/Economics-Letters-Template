<h1 data-label="687807" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><div>The  Use of blockchain technology in tax administration is better justified by the  characteristics or feature of the mechanics highlighted above which include:</div><div><b>Distributed ledger DLT</b>,  Blockchain technology uses a decentralized ledger system which greatly reduces  influence, control and manipulation by the central authority. This would  otherwise have called for intermediation which significantly increases costs of  transactions. </div><div><b>Decentralization of consensus</b>.  The distributed nature of the network requires untrusted participants to reach  a consensus. In a Blockchain, consensus can be based on “rules” (that  determine, e.g., which transactions are allowed and which are not, the amount  of bitcoins included in the block reward, the mining difﬁculty, etc.) or on the  history of “transactions” (which allows users to determine who owns what). The decentralized  consensus on transactions governs the update of the ledger by transferring the  responsibilities to local nodes which independently verify the transactions and  add them to the most cumulative computation throughput (i.e., the “longest  chain” rule). There is no integration point or central authority required to  approve transactions and set rules. No single point of trust and no single  point of failure.</div><div><b>Transparency.</b>  Records are audit able by a predeﬁned set of participants, although the set can  be more or less open. For example, in public blockchains everyone with an Internet  connection to the network holds equal rights and ability to access the ledger.  The records are thus transparent and traceable. Moreover, network participants  can exercise their individual (weighted) rights (e.g., measured in CPU  computing power) to update the ledger. Participants have also the option to pool  together their individual weighted rights.</div><div><b>Security.</b> Blockchains are  shared, tamper-proof, replicated ledgers where records are irreversible and  cannot be forged thanks to one-way cryptographic hash functions. Although  security is a relative concept, we can say that blockchains are relatively  secure because users can transfer data only if they possess a private key.  Private keys are used to generate a signature for each Blockchain transaction a  user sends out. This signature is used to conﬁrm that the transaction has come  from the user, and also to prevent the transaction from being altered by anyone  once it has been issued.</div><div><b>Immutability.</b>  Blockchains function under the principle of the non-repudiation and  irreversibility of records. Blockchains are immutable because once data has  been recorded in the ledger, it cannot be secretly altered ex-post without  letting the network know it (i.e., their data is tamper-resistant). In the Blockchain  context immutability is preserved thanks to the use of hashes (a type of a  mathematical function which turns any type of input data into a ﬁngerprint of fixed  size, that data called a hash. If the input data changes even slightly, the  hash changes in an unpredictable way) and often of blocks. Each block includes  the previous block’s hash as part of its data, creating a chain of blocks. The  strength of a given blockchain’s immutability is relative, and relates to how  hard the history of transactions is to change. Indeed, it becomes very difﬁcult  for an individual or any group of individuals to tamper with the ledger, unless  these individuals control the majority of “voters.” For public proof-of-work  blockchains such as Bitcoin, the immutability is related to the cost of  implementing a so-called “51% attack.” For private blockchains, the  block-adding mechanism tends to be a little different, and instead of relying  on expensive Proof-of-Work, the Blockchain is only valid and accepted if the  blocks are signed by a deﬁned set of participants. This means that, in order to  recreate the chain, one would need to know private keys from the other  block-adders. A complete discussion of threats to the immutability of a given  transaction history can be found in Barber (et al.) “Bitter to Better” (2012).9  While blockchains are technically immutable, from a governance perspective,  this immutability is never fully realized. There have been several examples  where the Bitcoin community has reverted Bitcoin blocks based on community  decisions. The division between Ethereum and Ethereum classic, and later  between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are not purely anecdotal  evidence: they are strong indicators of the importance that governing  bodies—even if informal—end up having on the information eventually stored in a  Blockchain.</div><div>Other  non-fundamental properties of blockchains include data automation and data  storage capacity.</div><div><b>Automation and smart contracts.</b>  Without the need for human interaction, veriﬁcation, or arbitration, the  software is written so that conﬂicting or double transactions are not  permanently written in the Blockchain. Any conﬂict is automatically reconciled  and each valid transaction is added only once (no double entries). Moreover,  automation regards also the development and deployment of smart legal contracts  (or smart contract codes, see Clack, Bakshi, and Braine, “Smart Contract  Templates” (2016)11) with payoff depending on algorithms which are  self-executable, self-enforceable, self-veriﬁable, and self-constrained.</div><div><b>Storage.</b> The storage space  available on Blockchain networks can be used for the storage and exchange of  arbitrary data structures. The storage of the data can have some size  limitations placed to avoid the “Blockchain bloat” problem.12 For example,  metadata can be used to issue meta-coins: second-layer systems that exploit the  portability of the underlying coin used only as “fuel.” Any transaction in the  second layer represents a transaction in the underlying network. Alternatively,  the storage of additional data can occur “off-chain” via a private cloud on the  client’s infrastructure or on public (P2Porthird-party) storage. Some blockchains,  like Ethereum, also allow the storage of data as a variable of smart contracts  or as a smart contract log event.</div>
