<h1 data-label="687807" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><div>I  felt that it is prudent to give some detail on the background and theoretical  underpinnings of the concept of blockchain, key characteristics and basic  architecture to enlighten and stimulate some interest in the readers. The same information  is the foundation on which the working Block chain based VAT administration  system is founded on. I discovered that an understanding of both the  traditional VAT system and the Blockchain is essential as the two technologies  and operational framework are combined to give this rather all encompassing VAT  system. It is also worth pointing out that, while others were made that the  terms Bitcoin and blockchain can be used interchangeably, they are different.  Blockchain is a technological platform on which Bitcoin is buttressed while the  later &nbsp;&nbsp;is just a digital currency.</div><div>The  concept of block chain though relatively new has received its significant share  of coverage both in literature and application.&nbsp;  The key in block chain is its ability to create the same yet more  flexible organizational set up, eliminating the need for central authority or  control and allowing unrelated individuals to safely transact without the need  for “trusted middleman” using consensus, smart contracts and computer  algorithms to provide independent verification and audit trail. Various writers  have provided varying versions of explanation with the one pioneering being a  white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash  System”&nbsp;(Nakamoto, 2008). While the paper  concentrated on the introduction of peer to peer currency system, the system is  based on the block chain technology which is of interest to this discussion.  Since some terms might sound a bit new to most readers. We should start by  giving a few definitions before delving into the architecture and operation of  a block chain technology in general.</div><div>Blockchain  is based on the Distributed Ledger Technology where computers operated by nodes  are interconnected by a network. In an open DLT there ledgers can join or leave  at will while in a permission there will be restrictions to joining. However  the fundamental architecture is that all nodes will share, network, database  and will operate within some shared digital guidelines to ensure consensus.</div><div>&nbsp;</div>
