In this system the transactions would follow the same order, assuming both  the buyer purchases the goods from the seller, the seller will bill the buyers  and issue a purchase invoice. The purchaser will, within the prescribed period  claim input tax while the seller accounts for output tax during the relevant  tax period. The two will submit their VAT submissions; independently to the tax  authority who will verify in retrospect if certain indicator or red flags are  raised. Certain points which block chain will address will be highlighted in  this transaction.</div><ol><li>The  purchaser is not able to verify the sellers VAT status</li><li>The  seller has motivation, unilaterally to sweep the each sale under carpet and  under declare sales on (his sale is only verified by audit)</li><li>The  tax authority may or may not refund on time depending on whether the refund is  identified for refund processing</li><li>The  tax authority might fail to identify risk (red flag cases) if done manually </li><li>The  tax officer might collude with client and fraudulently accept invalid claims</li></ol><div>The  purchaser may be tempted to “double spend” since verification spans over 12  months period before tax claim becomes invalid</div><div>The  purchaser may choose to claim a canceled purchase</div><div>Seller  may choose to report sales as canceled when the transaction actually went  through.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In  a simplified diagram of a blockchain based VAT system, the seller will signal  an intention to sell which is automatically broadcasted to all participating  nodes. Basing on the percentage of votes e.g. 75% vote from private  participants and All government nodes will confirm that the validity of the  transaction. Since there is no incentive system, the government nodes will  provide proof of identification (checking, amount, registration status of both  parties); the government nodes (acting as the central token mint) will reward  the purchaser with a VAT +token which is automatically entered into the  purchasers account. The seller also gets a VAT-token debit entered on his  account.&nbsp; The nodes will hash the  transaction Block and lock it into the chain using the hash of the previous  block. All ledgers are updated automatically. The transaction can only be  edited by a new transaction that under goes the same process of agreement by  consensus and added to the block creating an auditable and indelible trail. The  tokens are netted of at the end of each day and can be redeemed through exchange  with the local currency. This is shown diagrammatically below.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div>
