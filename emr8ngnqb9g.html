<h1 data-label="687807" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><div>As  can be seen from the building blocks of a blockchain block, each block contains  anything of Value be it transactions or assets. The block also contains a  digital key or hash, which is a set of alphanumeric characters generated by a  complex computational algorithm embedded in the software. The block will also  contain pointer to the hash of the previous block. This pointer/string ensures  immutability and auditabilty thereby creating a record that is permanent and  theoretically impossible to change. The blocks are linked by these hash until a  long chain of block is established, hence the name block chain. A small chain  is shown diagrammatically on the page below. </div>
