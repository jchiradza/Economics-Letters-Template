<h1 data-label="687807" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><div>Blockchain  technology is general and might in most cases not be the one size fit all  solution to a myriad of problems which the world faces. Different types of  block chains have evolved overtime. The identifiable major categories are  generally based on access to the blockchain and control. Each has distinct characteristics  that in principle will suite various uses, or functions.&nbsp;(Food and   Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations , 2019). Understanding of  these differences help to decide and build a model best suited for tax administration,  maximizing on the benefits and minimizing on the risks and weaknesses inherent  in the technology. </div><div><b>Consortium</b>:  A consortium formed by a group of members control this blockchain. Verifying  and adding records to the blockchain is based on a consensus mechanism by a  pre-selected set of nodes. Example: In regulatory related decision-making.</div><div><b>Private:</b> This is  controlled by a centralized entity. Only people with specific authentication  and permission can be part of this network and thereby can verify and add  records to the blockchain. However, the blockchain could be publically  viewable. Participants in this blockchain know and trust each other. Also known  as a permissioned ledger.</div><div><b>Public:</b> Public or  permissionless blockchain are decentralized and are visible to the public,  anyone can join or leave the blockchain and anyone can verify and append  transactions to the blockchain. This type of blockchain facilitates the dynamic  collection of participants who may not know each other. Hence, stringent  consensus mechanisms have to be implemented in this system.</div>
