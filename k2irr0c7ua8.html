<h2 data-label="655664" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>VAT  system in Zimbabwe is a migration in 2004 from the porous GST that was in place  since independence because of the weakness of General sale tax (GST) which have  been well document and reported by many countries including <i>pyramiding</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>and<i> cascading</i> which increases costs  substantially. According to A Nellen, the cost of commodities substantially  increases as the margin applied&nbsp; by third  parties or middleman also factor in the tax component and effectively results  in consumers being charged tax on tax for purchases unless they can provide the  required exemption documentation. (Nellen, 2007). The other challenge  being that only the final consumer pays tax in the case of GST creating  possible leakages from value addition along the value chain. To address these  and other GST challenges, and take advantage of VAT benefits, the Zimbabwean  government through an act of parliament introduced VAT, but not without its own  challenges. </div><div>Value-added tax (VAT) is a&nbsp;consumption  tax&nbsp;placed on a product whenever value is added at each stage of the  supply chain, from production to the point of sale.&nbsp;(Kagan, 2019).&nbsp; The mechanics of VAT suggests that after  adjusting for the input tax on purchases, only the value added will be taxed.&nbsp;(Zimbabwe Revenue Authority) The mechanics of VAT  therefore suggest that a tax payer will only pay for the difference between  input tax incurred in purchasing goods and the VAT charged on sale. Using a  simple example:</div><div>    Company A purchases  commodities to use as raw materials in its production process for ZWL15.00  excluding 15% VAT, plus a Input VAT of $2.25.The total price paid is ZWL17.25  VAT inclusive. Company A after processing will resell at ZWL30 to Company B and  charges 15% Output VAT amounting to ZWL4.50.&nbsp;In effect on paying to the  government Company A pays ZWL2.25 which is the difference between the Input VAT  and the Output VAT for the period. If the Retailer resale to the final consumer  at ZWL 50 plus 15 % Output VAT of ZWL7.50, then Company B will remit </div>
